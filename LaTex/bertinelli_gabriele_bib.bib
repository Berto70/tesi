              The smallest member of the Didymos binary near-Earth object system (Dimorphos) is the target of the DART/LICIACube mission, the first attempt to change the orbit of another celestial body via a kinetic impactor. It is important to characterize the unperturbed system prior to the DART impact. In this work we obtained, for the first time, spectral characterization of the system at several rotational phases from TNG+DOLORES in the visible range (0.34–0.81
              μ
              m). This is crucial in order to disentangle the primary and secondary bodies and highlight eventual dishomogeneities on their surfaces. We confirm that a subtle but persistent spectral variability appears, even when compared with data obtained from previous 2003 and 2019 apparitions. While the reason for such variability is still under investigation, our analysis hints that different compositions could play a role. Future observations during the brighter 2022 apparition in synergy with data obtained from LUKE on board LICIACube will definitely tackle this conundrum.},

            The Light Italian Cubesat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube) is part of the NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), the first mission aiming to demonstrate the applicability of the kinetic impactor method for planetary defense. The mission was launched on 2021 November 24 to perform the impact experiment on Dimorphos, the small secondary of the binary asteroid (65803) Didymos. The 6U LICIACube, stored as a piggyback of the DART spacecraft, is the first Italian mission operating in deep space managed by the Italian Space Agency that will witness the effects of the DART impact on Dimorphos. On board LICIACube, there is a suite of cameras that will perform imaging of Didymos and Dimorphos to investigate the DART impact effects and study the binary system. Among them, the LICIACube Unit Key Explorer (LUKE), a wide-angle camera coupled to an RGB Bayer pattern filter, will be pivotal to constrain the surface composition and heterogeneity of the binary system due to differences in surface properties linked with possible space weathering effects and/or the presence of exogenous material. Multiband photometric analysis of LUKE data and laboratory experiments in support of data interpretation will provide new insights on the binary asteroid nature and evolution. Moreover, photometric phase curve analysis will reveal the scattering properties of the granular surface medium providing important constraints for the microphysical properties of the Didymos–Dimorphos system. In this work, we will present the state of the art of the LUKE scientific activities with an overview of the instrument setup, science operations, and expected results.},

The data from the Hera spacecraft and its two CubeSats will also provide signiﬁcant insights into asteroid science and the evolutionary history of our solar system. Hera will perform the ﬁrst rendezvous with a binary asteroid and provide new measurements, such as radar sounding of an asteroid interior, which will allow models in planetary science to be tested.

	abstract = {Binary near-Earth asteroid (NEA) 65803 Didymos is the proposed Asteroid Impact \& Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission target, combining an orbiter [1] and a kinetic impactor for a planned encounter in fall 2022 [2]. The Dynamical and Physical Properties of Didymos Working Group supports this mission by addressing questions related to understanding the dynamical state of the system and inferring physical properties. Didymos is an Apollo-class NEA that likely reached its current orbit by exiting the inner main belt near or within the nu-6 resonance ({\textgreater} 82\% chance) [3]. Remote observations [4] show Didymos is spectroscopically most consistent with ordinary chondrites. The diameters of the binary components are measured to be about 780 and 160 m [5]. A model of the short-term binary dynamics suggests possible librations of the secondary with up to {\textasciitilde}10-deg amplitude, depending on its axial ratio. However, an equilibrium orbital and rotational solution is consistent with a libration amplitude of only {\textasciitilde}1 deg. The primary, with an estimated 2.1 g/cc bulk density (uncertainty 30\%) has a possibly super-critical rotation period of 2.26 h that may imply a cohesive strength of several tens of Pa. At this rate, perturbed regolith material may go through take-off/landing cycles and cause loss of fines due to solar radiation pressure. Based on a continuum analysis [6], the internal structure would likely fail before the equatorial region. A discrete analysis [7,8] shows that a minimum of 2.5 g/cc bulk density is needed for the structure to hold without cohesion. The system may be subject to weak thermal radiation forces (BYORP) with a period drift of no greater than 1 s/yr [9]. Experiments using the ISAE-SUPAERO drop tower [10] are underway to model the possible deployment of a lander on the secondary.

              We modeled photometric observations of mutual events (eclipses and occultations) between the components of the binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos, the target of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) space mission, which were taken from 2003 to 2021. We derived parameters of the modified Keplerian mutual orbit (allowing for a quadratic drift in the mean anomaly, which is presumably caused by an interplay between the BYORP effect and mutual tides, or by differential Yarkovsky force) of the secondary, called Dimorphos, around the Didymos primary and estimated its diameter.

	abstract = {We review the meteoritical and astronomical literature to answer the question: What is the evidence for the importance of ordinary chondritic material to the composition of the asteroid belt? From the meteoritical literature we find that currently: 1) our meteorite collections sample at least 135 different asteroids; 2) out of 25+ chondritic meteorite parent bodies, 3 are (by definition) ordinary chondritic; 3) out of 14 chondritic grouplets and unique chondrites, 11 are affiliated with a carbonaceous group/clan of chondrites; 4) out of 24 differentiated groups of meteorites, only the IIE iron meteorites clearly formed from ordinary chondritic precursor material; 5) out of 12 differentiated grouplets and unique differentiated meteorites, 8 seem to have had carbonaceous chondritic precursors; 6) a high frequency of carbonaceous clasts in ordinary chondritic breccias suggests that ordinary chondrites have been embedded in a swarm of carbonaceous material. The rare occurrence (only one example) of ordinary chondritic clasts in carbonaceous chondritic breccias indicates that ordinary chondritic material has not been widespread in the asteroid belt; 7) cosmic spherules, micrometeorites, and stratospheric interplanetary dust particles, believed to represent a less biased sampling of asteroidal material, show that only a very small fraction ({\textless} ?1\%) of asteroidal dust has an ordinary chondritic composition. From the astronomical literature we find that currently: 8) spectroscopic surveys of the main asteroid belt are finding more and more non-ordinary chondritic primitive material in the inner main belt; 9) the increase in spectroscopic data has increased the inferred mineralogical diversity of main belt asteroids; 10) no ordinary chondritic asteroids have been directly observed in the main belt. These lines of evidence strongly suggest a scenario in which ordinary chondritic asteroids were never abundant in the main belt. The S-type asteroids may currently be primarily differentiated, but the precursor material is more likely to have been carbonaceous chondritic, not ordinary chondritic. Historically, carbonaceous material could have dominated the entire main belt. This could explain the presence in the inner main belt of asteroids linked to the primitive carbonaceous chondrites, and the absence of asteroids linked to the ordinary chondrites. The implications of this scenario for the asteroid heating mechanism(s) are briefly discussed.},

              The reflectance spectra of the most abundant meteorites, ordinary chondrites, are different from those of the abundant S-type (mnemonic for siliceous) asteroids. This discrepancy has been thought to be due to space weathering, which is an alteration of the surfaces of airless bodies exposed to the space environment. Here we report evidence of space weathering on particles returned from the S-type asteroid 25143 Itokawa by the Hayabusa spacecraft. Surface modification was found in 5 out of 10 particles, which varies depending on mineral species. Sulfur-bearing Fe-rich nanoparticles exist in a thin (5 to 15 nanometers) surface layer on olivine, low-Ca pyroxene, and plagioclase, which is suggestive of vapor deposition. Sulfur-free Fe-rich nanoparticles exist deeper inside ({\textless}60 nanometers) ferromagnesian silicates. Their texture suggests formation by metamictization and in situ reduction of Fe

	abstract = {Radar observations of near-Earth asteroids have revealed a heterogeneous population with diameters spanning meter to kilometer scales, diverse shapes ranging from simple spheroids to extremely irregular bodies, and rotation periods stretching from minutes to weeks. Since 1998, when the Arecibo Observatory S-band radar system was upgraded to transmit up to 1 MW, over 300 near-Earth asteroids have been observed. Thane et al. (2012; AAS 219, \#432.14) examined those asteroids observed through 2010 that were well resolved at high power (above 600 kW output) and observed on multiple days allowing for unambiguous basic shape determination and found that the population was rather evenly distributed among spheroids, elongated bars, double-lobed contact binaries, multiple-asteroid systems, and irregularly shaped asteroids. This seems to imply that there is no dominant process of near-Earth asteroid evolution funneling the population to a general shape. Furthermore, there was no clear correlation between size and shape. We will expand the Thane et al. shape distribution to include objects observed from 2011-2012. We will also determine the spin distribution of radar-observed near-Earth asteroids, using the echo bandwidths to place upper limits on the spin periods of the bodies (allowing for comparisons to lightcurve-derived periods where available) and examine possible correlations between sizes, shapes, and spins.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a practical approach to the trajectory design for asteroid exploration missions with CubeSats is presented. When applied trajectories are sought, operative concerns and uncertainties affecting the spacecraft dynamics must be considered during the design process. Otherwise, trajectories that are possible on paper might become unfeasible when real-world constraints are considered. The risk of such eventualities leads to the urge of extending the trajectory design focus on the uncertainties affecting the dynamics and on the operative constraints derived by ground operations. This is especially true when targeting highly perturbed environments such as small bodies with low-cost solutions as CubeSats, whose capabilities in deep-space are still unknown. The case study presented is the Milani CubeSat which will be launched in 2024 with Hera in the frame of the AIDA mission.},

	abstract = {The binary YORP (BYORP) effect of solar radiation pressure on the orbit of a satellite around a primary orbiting the Sun was predicted by Ćuk and Burns (2005, Icarus 176, 418). McMahon and Scheeres (2010, CMDA 106, 261; Icarus, in press) gave a detailed derivation of the effect and proposed that it can be detected by tracking mean anomaly. We used their theory and scaling with their application to the binary 1999 KW4 for predicting a magnitude of change of the secondary orbit in binary systems using an updated dataset of binary asteroid parameters by Pravec and Harris (2007, Icarus 190, 250). Due to the inverse square-power dependence of the drift in mean anomaly on heliocentric semi-major axis as well as the primary diameter, the effect is largest in the smallest binaries orbiting closest to the Sun, i.e., among small near-Earth asteroid (NEA) binaries. We studied conditions of detectability of the predicted secular quadratic growth in mean anomaly compared to a Keplerian system by observations of mutual events between binary system components. Fits of a binary model to observed mutual events in previous apparitions gave a mean error of the mean anomaly measurements of 2-3 degrees with good-quality photometric observations (errors 0.01-0.02 mag). We identified seven binary NEA systems that are candidates for detection of the BYORP effect with such observations in their next apparitions during 2010-2015: (7088) Ishtar, (65803) Didymos, (66063) 1998 RO1, (88710) 2001 SL9, (137170) 1999 HF1, (175706) 1996 FG3 and (185851) 2000 DP107. Their predicted quadratic growth in mean anomaly is 0.24 to 3.3 deg/yr2. Photometric observations using telescopes with sizes about 2 m and smaller in their apparitions with V {\textless} 21 during 2010-2015 will give us data on event epochs in 4-6 apparitions (including their previous observed apparitions), allowing detection of BYORP in them.},

            We performed photometric observations of the binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos in support of the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission that will test the Kinetic Impactor technology for diverting dangerous asteroids. It will hit the Didymos secondary, called Dimorphos, on 2022 September 26. We observed Didymos with 11 telescopes with diameters from 3.5 to 10.4 m during four apparitions in 2015–2021, obtaining data with rms residuals from 0.006 to 0.030 mag. We analyzed the light-curve data and decomposed them into the primary rotational and secondary orbital light curves. We detected 37 mutual eclipse/occultation events between the binary system components. The data presented here, in combination with 18 mutual events detected in 2003, provide the basis for modeling the Dimorphos orbit around the Didymos primary. The orbit modeling is discussed in detail by Scheirich \& Pravec and Naidu et al. The primary light curves were complex, showing multiple extrema on some epochs. They suggest a presence of complex topography on the primary’s surface that is apparent in specific viewing/illumination geometries; the primary shape model by Naidu et al. (Icarus 348, 113777, 2020) needs to be refined. The secondary rotational light-curve data were limited and did not provide a clear solution for the rotation period and equatorial elongation of Dimorphos. We define the requirements for observations of the secondary light curve to provide the needed information on Dimorphos’s rotation and elongation when Didymos is bright in 2022 July–September before the DART impact.},

          , 
            We investigate the shape of near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu by constructing a high-resolution (20 cm) global digital terrain model from laser altimeter data. By modeling the northern and southern hemispheres separately, we find that longitudinal ridges previously identified in the north extend into the south but are obscured there by surface material. In the south, more numerous large boulders effectively retain surface materials and imply a higher average strength at depth to support them. The north has fewer large boulders and more evidence of boulder dynamics (toppling and downslope movement) and surface flow. These factors result in Bennu’s southern hemisphere being rounder and smoother, whereas its northern hemisphere has higher slopes and a less regular shape. We infer an originally asymmetric distribution of large boulders followed by a partial disruption, leading to wedge formation in Bennu’s history.},
